/**
 * Sidecar comment-thread store — the pure Node filesystem layer behind the
 * "comments as files" model. Unlike the foot-region store (src/foot.ts), which
 * keeps thread bodies inline in the document, this store gives each thread its
 * own DIRECTORY and each comment its own markdown FILE. The payoff: a comment
 * can hold arbitrary markdown — fenced code blocks, lists, multiple paragraphs —
 * none of which survives the single-line `<br>`-joined inline form.
 *
 * ## On-disk layout
 *     <baseDir>/
 *       t1/
 *         0001.md   ← first comment
 *         0002.md   ← reply
 *       t2/
 *         0001.md
 *
 * Each `NNNN.md` is a tiny `---`-delimited frontmatter block (string-valued
 * `author` / `created`) followed by the raw markdown body:
 *
 *     ---
 *     author: rjs
 *     created: 2026-06-29T10:00:00.000Z
 *     ---
 *     The markdown body of the comment.
 *
 * We hand-roll the frontmatter parse/serialize rather than pull in a YAML
 * dependency: the shape is fixed and trivial (a few `key: value` lines, plain
 * string values, no quoting/escaping needed for v0), so a real YAML parser would
 * be cost without benefit. Keeping it greppable plain text also matches the
 * repo's portability aim. If we ever need richer values, swap the two helpers
 * below and nothing else changes.
 *
 * Everything here is async (`node:fs/promises`) and side-effect-local: functions
 * read/write under `baseDir` and nowhere else, and tolerate a missing `baseDir`
 * or stray non-`NNNN.md` files so the store degrades gracefully.
