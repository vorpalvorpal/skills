/**
 * Sample documents for the read-view demo and the integration test.
 *
 * `OLD_MD` is the previous version, `NEW_MD` is "Claude's edit". They differ in
 * the body (an insertion and a deletion) and both carry a `<mark>` comment
 * anchor + matching `<article>` foot-region thread, so the demo exercises every
 * read-view feature: insert decoration, delete widget, and a sidebar thread.
 *
 * Body diff (above the final `---`):
 *   - inserted: "brown " before "fox"  (one inserted word)
 *   - deleted:  "lazy "   before "dog" (one deleted word)
 * The foot-region `<article>` differs too — and must NOT diff (foot-region rule).
