/**
 * Document-side write actions: the editor half of the three review operations
 * (add comment / reply / resolve). Since the sidecar refactor these touch only
 * the **anchor** in the document — applying or unwrapping the `:mark` directive.
 * The comment bodies themselves live in the `threads/<id>/` store and are managed
 * over HTTP by src/threads-client.ts (browser) / src/threads-store.ts (server);
 * "reply" has no document side at all, so it isn't here.
 *
 * ## The source-of-truth rule (document side)
 * The editor's ProseMirror doc is authoritative for the *document* (the prose and
 * its anchors). "Add" applies the anchor mark directly in PM space; "resolve"
 * unwraps it through the M0 serialise → string-transform → reload round-trip, so
 * the on-disk markdown and the editor never disagree and every mutation goes
 * through the exact serialiser the M0 gate proved faithful.
