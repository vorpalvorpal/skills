## Available Skills

### R Science

A workflow spine and supporting knowledge skills for **science-centered** R package development — where mathematical, statistical, physical, and biological correctness comes first and the code is functional by default. The skills chain together: **plan → tests → implement → verify → benchmark/optimise → review**.

> **One-command setup:** the `r-science` plugin bundles **every skill in this repo** — the spine below plus all the R-lib, posit-dev, GitHub, open-source, Quarto, Shiny, and ggsql skills — so `/plugin install r-science@rjs-skills` installs the complete toolkit. Install the individual plugins below only if you want a narrower set.

- **[conventions](./r-science/conventions/)** - Coding conventions for scientific R packages (correctness-first, functional by default, reproducible, referenced); ships a `CLAUDE.md` template for dropping into a package root
- **[whiteboard](./r-science/whiteboard/)** - Divergent, high-altitude "is this even the right thing to do?" exploration before planning — generates alternatives (including cross-disciplinary ones) and emits a design brief
- **[plan](./r-science/plan/)** - Correctness-first implementation planning that specifies behaviour and its correctness basis (equations, invariants, references, edge cases) precisely enough for tests to be derived from it
- **[tests](./r-science/tests/)** - Turn an approved plan into an executable behaviour specification — describe/it tests with analytic/invariant/reference/round-trip oracles and seeded stochastic tests
- **[implement](./r-science/implement/)** - Orchestrate implementation by delegating coding to subagents stage by stage: baseline benchmark, turn pending specs green, defer behaviour-changing optimisations to the user
- **[verify](./r-science/verify/)** - Staged quality gate returning READY / NOT READY, gating on correctness (behaviour specs pass) and cleanliness rather than a coverage percentage
- **[benchmark-optimise](./r-science/benchmark-optimise/)** - Profile and benchmark with `bench`/`profvis`; behaviour-preserving optimisations only, with behaviour-changing approximations deferred as modelling decisions
- **[review](./r-science/review/)** - Final review against the plan: plan conformance and scientific soundness, delegating general code- and test-quality review to the reviewer skills below
- **[critical-code-reviewer](./posit-dev/critical-code-reviewer/)** - General adversarial code review (also in posit-dev); `review` delegates code-quality findings to it
- **[review-testing](./posit-dev/review-testing/)** - General test-quality review (also in posit-dev); `review` delegates test-quality findings to it
- **[r-oop](./r-science/r-oop/)** - Decide whether a problem needs OOP at all, then pick the right system (S7 preferred, then S3; vctrs for vector-like types)
- **[r-bayes](./r-science/r-bayes/)** - Bayesian modelling with brms/Stan: DAG-based identification, justified priors, convergence as a hard gate, seeded reproducible fits
- **[frictionless](./r-science/frictionless/)** - Author, validate, and document tabular data as Frictionless Data Packages in R (CSV/Parquet + Table Schema), including provenance for reference/known-answer datasets

### Posit Developer

General-purpose developer skills useful across any language, project type, or context.

- **[critical-code-reviewer](./posit-dev/critical-code-reviewer/)** - Conduct rigorous, adversarial code reviews identifying security holes, lazy patterns, edge case failures, and bad practices across Python, R, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, and front-end code
- **[describe-design](./posit-dev/describe-design/)** - Research a codebase and create architectural documentation describing how features or systems work, with Mermaid diagrams and stable code references suitable for humans and AI agents
- **[review-testing](./posit-dev/review-testing/)** - Review test code for quality, design, and completeness after implementing a feature or fixing a bug, covering assertion completeness, mocking boundaries, fixture design, test smells, and coverage gaps


### GitHub

Skills for GitHub pull request workflows — creating PRs, addressing review feedback, and resolving threads.

- **[pr-create](./github/pr-create/)** - Creates a pull request from current changes, monitors GitHub CI, and debugs any failures until CI passes
- **[pr-threads-address](./github/pr-threads-address/)** - Review all unresolved PR review threads, address them by making necessary code changes, and commit the changes appropriately
- **[pr-threads-resolve](./github/pr-threads-resolve/)** - Bulk resolve unresolved PR review threads

### Open Source

Skills for open-source R and Python package developers, streamlining common workflows like releases, changelogs, and contributor acknowledgments.

- **[create-release-checklist](./open-source/create-release-checklist/)** - Create a release checklist and GitHub issue for an R package, with automatic version calculation and customizable checklist generation
- **[release-post](./open-source/release-post/)** - Create professional package release blog posts following Tidyverse or Shiny blog conventions, with support for both R and Python packages

### R Package Development

R package development skills for working with the r-lib ecosystem and modern R package workflows.

- **[testing-r-packages](./r-lib/testing-r-packages/)** - Best practices for writing R package tests using testthat 3+, including test structure, expectations, fixtures, snapshots, mocking, and BDD-style testing
- **[cli](./r-lib/cli/)** - Comprehensive guidance for using the cli R package for command-line interface styling, semantic messaging, and user communication with inline markup, progress indicators, and theming
- **[cran-extrachecks](./r-lib/cran-extrachecks/)** - Prepare R packages for CRAN submission by checking for common ad-hoc requirements not caught by `devtools::check()`, including documentation standards, DESCRIPTION field formatting, and URL validation
- **[lifecycle](./r-lib/lifecycle/)** - Manage R package lifecycle according to tidyverse principles using the lifecycle package, covering deprecation workflows, function/argument renaming, superseding, and experimental stages
- **[r-package-development](./r-lib/r-package-development/)** - R package development with devtools, testthat, and roxygen2, covering key commands, coding conventions, testing, documentation, and NEWS.md practices
- **[mirai](./r-lib/mirai/)** - Async, parallel, and distributed computing in R using mirai, covering explicit dependency passing, daemon setup, parallel mapping with `mirai_map()`, Shiny integration, remote/HPC launchers, and migration from future/parallel
- **[alt-text](./alt-text/)** - Generate and improve accessible alt text for data visualizations and images in pkgdown sites and Quarto documents, covering vignette code chunks (`fig.alt`), static markdown images, and multi-plot chunks

### ggsql

### Claude.ai

Skills can be uploaded to Claude.ai following the [Creating Custom Skills guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills).

### Claude API

Use the [Skills API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills-guide) to programmatically load and manage skills in your applications.

## Using Skills

Once installed, Claude will automatically activate relevant skills based on your task. You don't need to explicitly invoke them.

For example, with the `release-post` skill installed:

```
You: Help me write a release post for dplyr 1.2.0

Claude: I'll help you create a release post. First, let me gather some information...
```

Claude will use the skill's knowledge to guide you through creating a properly formatted release post.
